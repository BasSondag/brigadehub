# Contribution Guidelines

If something is unclear, confusing, or needs to be refactored, please let me know.
Pull requests are always welcome, however, please open an issue before
submitting a pull request. This project uses
[feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) with a
few minor exceptions. If you are submitting a pull request that involves
Jade templates, please make sure you are using *spaces*, not tabs. Please also ensure
your styling matches the `.csscomb.json` file included with the project.
